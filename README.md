## Template

This Repository uses a [Typescript Template](https://github.com/NewCeptionDev/AdventOfCodeTemplate-for-TS) based on a Template from caderek found [here](https://github.com/caderek/aoc-starter-ts). <br>
It provides zero-setup environment for challenges, with:

- automatic creation of a challenge template,
- automatic execution of a challenge code (with reloads),
- quick utils for testing and reading input from a file.
